# OSVR JSON Schemas

> Maintained at <https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-JSON-Schemas>

Shared JSON schemas for the OSVR ecosystem - used across multiple projects, so placed in a separate repository to have a single point of truth.

If you're seeing this as a subdirectory somewhere, that's probably because the schemas were included as a Git submodule or other similar mechanism. See the link above for the latest versions.
